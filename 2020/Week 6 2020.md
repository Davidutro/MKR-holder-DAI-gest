## Governance News

### Become a decision-MKR
One of the key features of the MakerDao ecosystem is Governance.  When you buy and stake MKR, you get the ability to vote on critical MakerDao policies.   

Greater voter participation creates a more secure platform.  There is no minimum amount of MKR required to participate in MakerDao Governance.  Here are some resources to learn more about setting up and using the Governance tools: 

* [Voter Onboarding Guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/onboarding/voter-onboarding)
* [Video Voting Tutorial](https://youtu.be/wP7DedWcEmg)
* [Governance Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance)

### [New Governance Dashboard](https://mkrgov.science/)

A new Governance Dashboard is in development which you can find [here](https://mkrgov.science/). Statistics of the Governance system, participants, and much more are available. Search filters and sorting allow a user to generate very specific data. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the new version. Help icons in the right corner of every graph provide detailed help information.  You can view a formal walkthrough presentation in this week's Governance meeting video.  If you have questions, the [Governance Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) is the perfect place to ask the community.
