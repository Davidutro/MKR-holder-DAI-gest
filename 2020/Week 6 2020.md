# Active and Upcoming Executive Votes

## Executive Vote: Activate Sai Debt Ceiling, Sai, and Dai Stability Fee Adjustments
Executed on February 4, 2020

This vote executed the following:

* Raised the Dai Stability Fee from 8% to 9%

     * Note: With the current Dai Savings Rate Spread of 0.25%, the DSR will also increase to 8.75%

* Raised the Sai Stability Fee from 9% to 10%

* Lowered the Sai Debt Ceiling by 15 million to 30 million Sai

The Dai stability fee is part of the ecosystem that keeps the Dai soft pegged to the price of a dollar and allows prime interest rates for Dai held in savings.
This is part of the roadmap in settling the global supply of SAI as it reaches end of life. It incentivizes faster repayment of CDP vaults held as SAI collateral
with lower stability fees that increase over time. The goal is to achieve global settlement in six months time. Additonal measures include decresing the debt ceiling
as the end of life approaches. SAI stability fees will be refunded upon global settlement. This is coming in the wake of the newly released multi-collateral DAI. SAI holders are encouraged to migrate these coins to DAI as soon as possible. For more information: https://migrate.makerdao.com/
