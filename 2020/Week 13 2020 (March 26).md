Hello reader.  The world is werid right now. I just wanted to have a little heart to heart with you and remind you that you are love and loved.  Submitted for your consideration:  Whether you are happy, sad, apathetic, or panicing over Sabertooth Corona-swine-sars-19 news feeds, you have everything you need.  Maybe you are a vault holder that lost some assets in the recent past weeks.  Guess what?  More cryptocurrency is minted every day.  More stuff is manufactured every day.  More ideas are thought up every day.  There is only one thing that is not high volume mass produced every day: your time.  My time.  Time.  Cherish it all in happiness.  What ever you think you have lost, or whatever you think worrying about will fix, or whomever pissed you off to the point of bringing you to the brink.  Have a moment of gratitude and love and remember you are a magnificent being that can have all the currency, all the things, all the ideas again: whenever you want.  All you have to do is choose what you want instead of choosing what you lack.  The universe, I've noticed, is quite literal when it listens.  The more I have "wanted" I was answered with more "want" - The more I said Thank-you, I was answered with abundance.  Set aside worry, doubt, and fear and shine your light into the world.  It's a better world with you..you..you...and you...(oh, but not you...just kidding) in it. #feelings

# Big 3 Take-aways for the week:

* For those that utilize the services and products on the MakerDAO platform, risk of losing all of what you have invested is possible at any time.  Such as anything material.  Extensive analysis and resources are spent on building safety and security into this complex machine proactively, but it is impossible to plan for every scenario.  Investing of anykind requires due diligence, upon which it is the investors responsibility to locate data that is accurate and pertinent prior to investing.

* Information is abundant on MakerDAO.com, however, not easy to find.  This week I am launching a survey campaign to gague perception of MakerDAO information ease of access, clarity, and useability.  Please take a moment to complete this four question survey.   [Link to Survey - Please Complete. It's Just four questions and a funny ending slide](https://www.opinionstage.com/adrian-hacker/customer-satisfaction-survey)

* In the midst of uncertainty and fear surrounding the recent black swan, MakerDAO achieves a huge milestone:  Control of the Maker Token is 100% turned over to the Governance group.  MakerDAO is consistent and accomplished when it comes to the pursuit of full decentralization.  Steps forward in uncertainty create a culture that can adapt and even thrive when things get high-pressure and high-stakes.

## Recapping Last Week's Events

The MakerDAO foundation members along with governance and risk members worked very hard to respond to a system security event.  MakerDAO foundation members have been working very hard to analyze, model, and understand the sequence and implication of what happened.  Results will be published when they are available.  Outside consultants are also being brought in to help analyze and prevent such an occurance.  If you ever doubt the efforts invested in making MakerDAO safe for all, I urge you to watch the four governance and risk calls from last week.  Quick action, bright ideas, and level heads prevailed.

## Night is Darkest Just Before Dawn

## Vault Holder Compensation

A lot of strong activity and effort this week was put into the continued post mortem analysis of the black Thursday Swan-a-thon.  Forward momentum is very strong in terms of analyzing best choices moving forward.  There were some vault holders that may have possibly lost collateral beyond the requirement to repay thier debt.  The Governance group is seeking the balance of favorable perceptions, listening and supporting, asserting zero liability, zero precenence for implied liability or contributory negligence claims.  The MakerDAO platform was operational and fully fucntional, as it was intended, when these perceived losses occured.  In the mid-19th century, when pioneers were settling the West in the United States, risk was the way of life in hope of greater opportunity.  The MakerDAO foundation team and governance community is committed to learning all there is to know about the causality of this glitch to ensure system security.

## Debt Auctions Blocked in the DAI Credit System

A minor glitch has caused around twenty flop auctions to become stuck in a state preventing auction start.  This is a minor issue.  Stability is not affected.  As a work around, Governance can enact Executive Votes which will unfreeze these stalled auctions, and allow the affected 1 million Dai to be raised for system debt settlement.  [This Link](https://youtu.be/erh25lnaIo0?t=487) will take you to the beginning of a detailed presentation of the system problem and technical overview.  Or, [take the fast lane to the forum signaling thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-thread-finishing-flops-and-current-executive/1795).  Links to issues details are provided as well as a poll for handling voting logistics with regards to the backlog of auctions.

## Monetary Policy actions and thier implications on MakerDAO

The last couple of weeks have heard this sentement on more than one occasion:  Do we know how monetary policy actions have truly affected other parameters of the ecosystem?  What systems are in place to record and analyze data that is a result of monetary policy?  It has not been a formal agenda subject, but concern and questions are coming up seeking to understand what  we really understand and how we're reaching conclusions that are consistent and correct.  There is agreement of the need to further explore this issue, however, it has thus far been tabled in favor of more pressing issues or people's time.  :)

## [Governance Initiative: DeFi Consortium on Emergency Shutdown Criterion]( https://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-initiative-defi-consortium-on-emergency-shutdown-criterion/1829)

Now forming: a small but well represented consortium of MakerDAO platform and outer ecosystem stake holders to develop formal guidance and framework for using the system Emeregency Shutdown.  Check out details in the forum thread, ask questions, or cast your hat in for consideration in being a participant.  WANTED: IF YOU KNOW ANYONE PLEASE PASS ALONG THIS COMMITTEE FORMATION:  Seeking outer edge high-stake ecosystem stake holders.  This includes representatives of DEX and Dapps based around the DAI-conomy. Emergency Shutdown affects any and all Dai holders or variant integrations in serious ways.  Participation from outer ecosystem operational teams is needed and highly appreciated.

## SCD shutdown is still out in the future some months, but beginning to take formal shape in Governance

This [forum thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sequential-process-for-scd-shutdown/1823) begins turning the shutdown of SCD into a reality.  Highlighting a draft of the technical steps that will be taken to shut down single collateral Dai, formal process and procedures are evolving.  If you are holding any Sai, now is the time to head over to [the official migration site](https://migrate.makerdao.com) and turn them into Dai.  If you still have an open SCD vault, repayment or conversion to an MCD vault will ensure the safety and security of your assets.

## [USDC Usage Analytics](https://youtu.be/hc3NCt7hcnw?t=2833)

The new USDC collateral type approved and implemented by MakerDAO governance was selected based upon two very specific use cases: 

* Being able to generate Dai liquidity for flop auctions.  Dai is in short supply as recent market price scares have caused Dai holders to hodl on to thier Dai for dear life.

* Dai Peg Arbitrage.  

An evaluation of the 10 largest USDC vaults was presented which brought some insight into the use of Dai backed by USDC.  It is estimated that approximately 50% of USDC held is being used to provide Dai liquidity.  Two larger vaults have been traced back to other DeFi platforms.  Having Dai generated and held within the system is ideal.  The governance community is discussing the creation of two USDC based collateral types:  USDC-A and USDC-B.  Each variant will have monetary policy settings that incentivize thier respective use case.

Questions arose around the availability of USDC backed Dai metrics.  While there is no formal dashboard or availability of metrics yet, actionable data is being presented in the weekly governance calls.  The forward movement to dive deeper into the metrology of USDC and respectively backed Dai was highlighted and assured as a priority in the governance group.

## State of the Peg

Constrained Dai liquidity has been persistent as crypto market fears linger.  Dai holders are less motivated to sell because of the stability offered by Dai during these uncertain times.  The peg has been running at a spread of (L)$1.02-(H)$1.04 over the last week.  Although high, this price point has been stable which is a good sign.  

Dai that is created by Eth-A remained flat as price instability fears remain in the forefront of people's investing fears.  Until a slightly higher peg is to be expected while Dai demand is high and supply stays constrained.  Completing all of the flop auctions is a high priority to help releive the current Dai liquidation crunch.

## Sai Migration

Sai migration slowed this last week  in comparison to weeks prior.  Again, market fears are the suspected cause of the slow down in Sai to Dai conversion. An approximate total of 1.4 million Sai were migrated.  Debt ceiling reduction to limit supply will continue.
