## How to Purchase DAI with Cash in the U.S. (No Bank Account, Credit Card, or Debit Card Required)

Maybe you have visited the [coinstar machine](https://coinstar.com) in the grocery store when cashing in your stockpiles of change, or just seen them when checking out.  These kiosks now offer the ability to [buy Bitcoin](https://coinstar.com/bitcoin) with cash.  You can easily turn that into DAI and lock in an amazing savings rate on the [Oasis](https://oasis.app/?lang=en) DeFi platform by MakerDAO.

* Open a [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) account and complete the 'know your customer requirements'

* Purchase Bitcoin from the Coinstar Kiosk using cash.  A voucher will be printed that you can redeem online

* Use a Coinbase receive address for Bitcoin when redeeming your voucher

* When the Bitcoin has posted to your Coinbase account, select Trade to turn your Bitcoin into DAI (Specify an amount or choose the maximum amount to exchange all Bitcoin)

* Send your DAI to a Web3 capable wallet such as Metamask or Coinbase Wallet and head to [Oasis](https://oasis.app/?lang=en)

* Click 'Save' and follow the prompts to lock your DAI into an amazing savings interest rate, that not even your mom's credit union could match!
