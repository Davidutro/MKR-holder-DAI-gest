Maker Holder DAI-gest is a publication by the community, for the community. While trying to remain completely objective, none of the statements or opinions shared here reflect that of the MakerDAO foundation. The best way to stay informed about governance and risk current events is through engagement with the community. This summary may not present all sides of an issue. You are encouraged to seek further information on topics of interest.

Three-Point Governance Summary:

* Prices across the cryptocurrency market, including Ether dropped sharply this week triggering a large amount of liquidation auctions.  The Ethereum network was so busy that gas prices became extremely high and transaction times took much longer than usual.  During this time a keeper was able to bid zero or extremely low ball bids to win liquidation auctions.  This resulted in a system debt around 5 million Dai.

  * High gas prices and a low amount of keepers online to bid were contributing factors.
  * The zero / low bidder inflated the amount of gas they paid to expedite their transactions.
  * Oracle prices were very slow to update due to Ethereum traffic congestion.
  * DAI users / holders are not affected. 
  * Some vault owners are affected.
  * MKR holders are affected.

* MKR auctions will soon begin selling lots of 250 MKR with a starting bid of 50,000 Dai.  Auctions that are not won will be reduced in price by 20% until the lot sells.  MKR auctions will continue until the system debt is paid.

* The state of the peg has been running high with a seven day max at $1.22.  People have been turning to the DAI stablecoin during this time of extreme price volatility.  This is a good sign showing that the uncapitalized debt is not affecting the value of Dai.

Here you can find a [glossary of terms](https://mkrdai.info/glossary).

A flip auction is the auctioning of an undercollateralized vault.  
A flop auction is a MKR auction to recapitalize system debt.  \
TTL is the maximum length of time of a bid.

This weeks executive vote was a series of auction parameter adjustments to prevent future value loss through zero bidding / low bidding.  Also an adjustment to monetary policy to bring the Dai price down to get back on soft-peg.

# Governance Hot Topics

*  Sai migration jumped this week.  Sai supply is at approximately 20 million, which has dropped 11.5 million in the last week.  This is the effort to phase out and settle the entire Sai supply and fully convert to multi-collateral Dai.  If you are a Sai holder, you should [migrate ASAP](https://migrate.makerdao.com/).  

* There is a need to get more people involved in the system as auction keepers (bidders).  The documentation is highly technical and a bridge for accessibility needs to be made through less technically dense docs or sample download apps.
