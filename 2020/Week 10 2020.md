# MKR holder DAI-gest: Week 10 2020
## Governance Recap March 5, 2020

 https://mkrdai.info

Maker Holder DAI-gest is a publication by the community, for the community.  While trying to remain completely objective, none of the statements or opinions shared here reflect that of the MakerDAO foundation. 

Three-Point Governance Summary:

1)  [Precedent for on-chain polling:](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-precedent-for-on-chain-polling/1400) No formal signaling process exists for foundation members.  How should this be addressed?  How should urgent governance issues be addressed which may require immedeate action?  Are there situations where the signaling process could and should be abbreviated or appended?  Community input needed; follow the link to the forum thread.

2)  [Collateral Risk Model](https://youtu.be/ZT8flAjPKLU): **SOMETHING EVERY GOVERNANCE COMMUNITY MEMBER SHOULD WATCH** In the call this week, a presentation is given about credit risk modeling.  Approving new types of collateral is essential to the growth of the system and is a governance issue.  This presentation provides an orientation and roadmap for handing this off to the community.  The presentation can be found at 45:00min into the call.  #mustseetv

3)  Important debates are coming up weekly but discussion thread in the weekly call lacks continuity.  Food for thought / how to handle?
