EXCLUSIVE BLOG BY ADRIAN:  [Your Bank is Just Not that Into You: (How Your Bank is #%@&ing You Over)](https://medium.com/@ahacker.or.us/your-bank-is-just-not-that-into-you-94791b3be135)

Three Point Governance Summary by Adrian:

1) Individually and as a community, it is important to stop often and reassess our efforts within the Maker ecosystem.
Still relevant? Is there a higher priority? Is it value added? Must have, or would be nice? Maker is growing quickly
making it that much more critical to quickly adapt if/when yesterdays top priority may have just become obsolete.  

2) Watch the presentation on Oracles and Governanace in this weeks video recording of the governance meeting. The security of
the Maker platform relies on a variety of information providers (Oracles) and Governance is tasked with administrating these
sources and their security to the ecosystem..  Watch the presentation and next week a draft of administrative procedures will 
be posted in the forum.  Read it.  Ask questions.  Give feedback.  

3) The top few CDPs hold over 25% of the DAI supply.  Keep an eye on them if they are auctioned or redeemed. The large
trade volume may require immedeate response to keep DAI on peg.

* [Poll: Should we reduce the frequency of the DSR Spread governance poll to once per month?](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmxvvzb6uei1jawvtxentsbreepfkuzsohaefpw6j4vpn5)

  This poll closed today (Thursday) and was voted "NO" to the astonishment of the community.  This is an important issue.  Adjustments that
  happen every week give very little time for the effect of a change to be realized.  This initiative is important to give more time
  between adjusting critical ecosystem vitals to fully understand the change (if any) that occurs.

* [Dai Savings Rate Spread Adjustment - February 24, 2020](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmewwftkvpcnqzmfrskryenlpqj4qqxqtzi9djxa8k9wn3)

  This poll passed a rate of 1%.  The current set point is 0%.
  
* [Poll: Debt Ceiling Adjustment - February 24, 2020](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmfy3resrmo97rqyfffpndujszvbv59zuacfl3rxpcu2wx)

   This poll result was "YES":
    * Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 5 million to 25 million Sai
    * Lower the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 20 million to 130 million Dai
    
Other polls this weeks for Dai Stability Fee and Sai Stability Fee resulted in no change, which remains 8% and 9.5% respectively.

## Disaster Preparedness

A hot topic of debate this week in the community is how to handle the occurence of an Ethereum hardfork if it were to happen.
Just to be clear, there is not a hard fork planned or announced.  The community just wants to have some plans in place if
this happened.  Many considerations involving the Maker platform as well as partner platforms and much more need to be considered.
To find out more information on the issue dive in to the community forum:  [Should MKR governance get involved with Ethereum hard forks?](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/should-mkr-governance-get-involved-with-ethereum-hard-forks/1353)
