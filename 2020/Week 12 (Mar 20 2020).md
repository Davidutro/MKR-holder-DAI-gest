##  Recapping Last Week's Events

A huge cryptocurrency market drop in prices triggered a mass liquidation event in which auction keepers were able to bid on collateral auctions at a price of zero or very low Dai.  Ethereum blockchain congestion due to market panic slowed updated price information from oracles and imposed very high gas fees on all transactions.  This made it impractical or impossible for diversified auction bidding and allowed single zero/low bid auctions to be won.  This perfect storm of events caused a system debt of around $5 million Dai.  The Maker platform was functioning as intended, there were no technical malfunctions.   To reconcile this debt the system is set to generate flop auctions.  A flop auction is where a larger amount of MKR token is sold at auction, at a slightly reduced price, to generate Dai that pays down the debt.

## The Undiscovered Country

The Maker community rallied this week with thier nose to the grind to produce some corrective actions very quickly.  The overall state of the Maker platform is **HEALTHY**.  The "down-to-business" atmosphere in the forums and on the Governance calls has sparked very creative, thought provoking, and polarizing questions to be answered.  MakerDAO is a decentralized finance platform.  It is economy created through community.  Anyone can participate in a variety of ways.  Being a Maker token holder gives the right to vote on system governance and risk directly.  Dai holders brings stability and legitimacy to the platform through saving, spending, and holding the Dai stable coin.  Furthermore, third party integrations of Dai such as cDai (compound dai) and other variants have been created based on the Dai stable coin.  Vault holders initiate an automated smart contract with the system to which Dai is generated through held collateral.  

The beauty of this system comes from the diversity of the whole group, the ability for anyone to participate, and the ability for anyone to contribute ideas or time.  Monetary policy is set by the Maker holders weekly Executive Vote.  Blockchain technology keeps the financial network public, encrypted, and widespread.  Attackers are hard pressed to gain access to any part of this system, as it is virtually impossible.  Because the blockchain is hosted by hundreds or thousands of different individuals (anyone can host a node) it is impossible to bring the system down.

There is no central bank that decides policies affecting everyone.  There is no behind the scenes authority or power that levreges the Maker platform for thier own greedy motives.  This is run by the people it directly affects.  People like you, like me, all are welcome.  All can benefit.  

That being said, this does bring the "Undiscovered Country."  The events of last week formulated a perfect storm for which no imagined case could practically be thought up prior to happening.  Cryptocurrency and defi are new technologies.  Platforms like MakerDAO are pioneering this technology.  Not all scenarios have been imagined.  Not all risks have been realized.  While the MakerDAO community strives very hard to anticipate all risk vectors, there are just those pieces of emerging technology that "we didn't know, we didn't know."  To that end, here is a summary of this weeks governance and community happenings in response:
