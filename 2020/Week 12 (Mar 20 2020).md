##  Recapping Last Week's Events

A huge cryptocurrency market drop in prices triggered a mass liquidation event in which auction keepers were able to bid on collateral auctions at a price of zero or very low Dai.  Ethereum block chain congestion due to market panic slowed updated price information from oracles and imposed very high gas fees on all transactions.  This made it impractical or impossible for diversified auction bidding and allowed single zero/low bid auctions to be won.  This perfect storm of events caused a system debt of around $5 million Dai.  The Maker platform was functioning as intended, there were no technical malfunctions.   To reconcile this debt the system is set to generate flop auctions.  A flop auction is where a larger amount of MKR token is sold at auction, at a slightly reduced price, to generate Dai that pays down the debt.

## The Undiscovered Country

The Maker community rallied this week with their nose to the grind to produce some corrective actions very quickly.  The overall state of the Maker platform is **HEALTHY**.  The "down-to-business" atmosphere in the forums and on the Governance calls has sparked very creative, thought provoking, and polarizing questions to be answered.  MakerDAO is a decentralized finance platform.  It is economy created through community.  Anyone can participate in a variety of ways.  Being a Maker token holder gives the right to vote on system governance and risk directly.  Dai holders brings stability and legitimacy to the platform through saving, spending, and holding the Dai stable coin.  Furthermore, third party integration's of Dai such as cDai (compound Dai) and other variants have been created based on the Dai stable coin.  Vault holders initiate an automated smart contract with the system to which Dai is generated through held collateral.  

The beauty of this system comes from the diversity of the whole group, the ability for anyone to participate, and the ability for anyone to contribute ideas or time.  Monetary policy is set by the Maker holders weekly Executive Vote.  Block chain technology keeps the financial network public, encrypted, and widespread.  Attackers are hard pressed to gain access to any part of this system, as it is virtually impossible.  Because the block chain is hosted by hundreds or thousands of different individuals (anyone can host a node) it is impossible to bring the system down.

There is no central bank that decides policies affecting everyone.  There is no behind the scenes authority or power that leverages the Maker platform for their own greedy motives.  This is run by the people it directly affects.  People like you, like me, all are welcome.  All can benefit.  

That being said, this does bring the "Undiscovered Country."  The events of last week formulated a perfect storm for which no imagined case could practically be thought up prior to happening.  Cryptocurrency and defi are new technologies.  Platforms like MakerDAO are pioneering this technology.  Not all scenarios have been imagined.  Not all risks have been realized.  While the MakerDAO community strives very hard to anticipate all risk vectors, there are just those pieces of emerging technology that "we didn't know, we didn't know."  To that end, here is a summary of this weeks governance and community happenings in response:

# Current Issues

There have been daily governance and risk calls about all of these issues.  The YouTube link to the recordings can be found below.  This section is grouped together by subject which may have evolved over multiple meetings.

## USDC

The stable coin USDC joins the ranks of eligible collateral for opening vaults.  This comes as Dai liquidity is scarce, but need for auction bidders to claim won lots.  During the crypto price fiasco, many people have turned to Dai as the harbor in the storm, and thus driven demand to very high levels.  The inflated peg price has also incentivized the use of Dai elsewhere other than auctions.  The necessity for a stable coin in the collateral portfolio is a certainty.  Some of the characteristics of USDC however bring questions and concerns.

USDC is a stable coin that is issued by Circle.  It is a fiat backed coin that is subject to regulations and monitoring like that of the actual U.S. dollar.  This is contradictory to decentralization.  The primary use case for the collateral is solely for auction participation at this point in time.  A higher collateralization ratio (~125%) is a hopeful deterrent to other uses of the coin beside auction liquidity.  A modest stability fee that is competitive with other exchanges is one option so as to bring the bulk of around 7 million Dai back to the Maker platform.  This amount of Dai is locked in other exchanges, and it is a "would be nice" action item to draw the bulk of that back to Maker.  A policy change on other exchanges could trigger mass liquidation which is undesirable.  A modest debt ceiling for USDC will minimize exposure to the risk of this collateral.  The biggest risk:  black listing.  If Circle detects nefarious use of USDC funds, they can black list specific addresses.  The whole of the collateral is stored in a single address adapter and could potentially invalidate the value of collateral if the unlawful actions of a third party were traced to the Maker platform.

## Flop Auctions

An overview of the flop auction mechanism was given.  This is the auction used to reconcile system debt.  A starting bid of 50,000 Dai at 250 MKR (-3% discount) starts the bidding.  A winning bid can close the auction in 6 hours or the 3 day maximum length of the auction can close the auction.  Zero bids will re-trigger a new auction with a discount of 30% MKR for 50,000 Dai.

[auctions.makerdao.com](https://auctions.makerdao.com) is the new user friendly site for becoming an auction keeper.  It is currently only in use for flop auctions, but will soon be implemented for all auction types.  You no longer need to be a rocket surgeon to participate in auctions.

A bug was discovered in the deployment of flop auctions on Thursday.  This caused 8 or 9 auctions not to go live, but rather reserved them to be eligible for repayment only through surplus or stability fees.  Governance is able to override this.  The severity of the bug is minor and does not present a direct attack vector.  The community feels strongly about not moving too quickly to correct it, but rather work to fully understand the issue. In this climate of very dynamic system parameters it is crucial not to change to many parameters without fully understanding the impact of these changes.  #theundiscoveredcountry
